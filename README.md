# Real Hogs

Shopify theme + assets for **Real Hogs** (subscription hat club).

## What’s in here
- A custom lightweight Shopify theme (Liquid + JSON templates)
- Homepage optimized for a single primary CTA: **Subscribe ($29.99/mo)**
- Placeholder brand kit (logo + palette + type)

## Next steps (when you’re back at a computer)
1. Create the Shopify store → you’ll get `https://<store>.myshopify.com`
2. Install a subscription app (default target: **Shopify Subscriptions**)
3. Add your first product (e.g. “Real Hogs Hat Club”) and enable subscriptions
4. Upload/publish this theme

## Dev notes
This theme is intentionally minimal (no build step). Edit CSS in `assets/base.css`.
